I see a lot of kids on this train nowadays.

Younger every year--and never as prepared as they should be! This city can eat a {playerSprite} alive; I've seen it happen.
You know, {if (misspeciated > 0) "I'm more hip to youth culture than I look" else "I learn a lot by sitting next to kids like you"}. For instance, I know you can't tell a {playerSprite}'s gender just by looking anymore.
I bet if you answer a few questions for me, I can guess yours!
* Um, sure.
* What? That's none of your business.
    So it's none of your business? Way to spoil the fun.

My first question is:
There are two trolleys. One is on track to collide with five innocent people, but the other one spews toxic gas, slowly killing thousands via air pollution. Which one do you take to work?
* Manslaughter Express

* Complicity Caboose

    "Evades hypothetical questions." Check.
- Next question. What is your favorite color?
* Chartreuse
    Excellent choice.

* Mauve
    Really? Hmm.

* (wordy) Synaesthesia
    Well I guess that counts.
- Next question. Do you think you're more likely to compliment a stranger, or call one out?
* Compliment
    ~ charm += 1;
* Call-out
    ~ charm -= 1;
- Okay, one more left.
Would you rather be adoptable, or adaptable?
* Adoptable
    ~ virtue -= 1;
* Adaptable
    ~ virtue -= 2;
* (uncultured) Is that supposed to be from something?
    You've never seen the Jimmy-Timmy Power Hour? Good God.

Well, that's everything. Knowing all that about you, I'd have to guess that your gender is... {gender}.

    Ha! I've never met a {gender} before. Nice to meet you.
* No way. I'm a {randAlt}.

    Whoops. I'm so sorry!
* It's actually none of your business.    
    Oh. I'm sorry.

It's just pretty disrespectful that everyone makes assumptions about me. I'm actually Christian. I'm not gonna say that I hate you, but I really don't think you should be doing that. I used to dress up as {gender} but then I realized God is happier when I don't do that.

My parents warned me when I moved into this apartment that I'd be in a bad neighborhood. That didn't make sense to me. The building was so nice!
The thing I realized is that the businesshumans who made the building didn't really understand the concept of home. And they didn't care that their big expensive building for rich people was going up right next to the dog park.
It gets so sad walking these streets to get to my luxury apartment and seeing old, stray dogs everywhere. Shouldn't this building be for them? There are literally dozens of empty beds inside.

Just because you feel crummy right now doesn't mean you lived every day this week making the wrong decisions! At least some of those choices were the right ones. Sometimes days are just bad and it's not our fault. I promise.
// TODO the lamp breaks

// TODO friends back home went drinking without me. When is this city gonna feel right?
